Source code contributed to LABS-CC is expected to meet a level of standards
that will not have detrimental effects to the end user's data, hardware, 
or software.  Source code should be clearly readable, well documented and 
written in a safe and secure manner.

Proposed changes to existing source code must include a well thought out
reason for the change and if applicable proof that the code does not break
any of the other standards in this form.
